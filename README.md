# RDL- dataFileReduction
This is a program that takes the raw data acquired from labview in a .tdms file from testing at the test cell, 
and reduces it for a final output .xlsx file that is easier to use for data reviewp and saves storage. 

To use:
Download this folder.
Open the command prompt. This can be done by typing `cmd` into the search bar on windows. 
Change the directory of the command prompt to the directory where the `dataFileReduction.py` file is located.
This can be done by typing `cd c:\XXX\XXX\` and pressing enter. 
Then type `python dataReductionFile.py` and press enter to run the script.
The script will then prompt for the path location of the .tdms file on the computer. This can 
be anywhere on the computer. The next thing that will be prompted for is the name of the .tdms file. 
The program will then output a reduced .xlsx file.
